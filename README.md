## My Contribution: Reservation Module

As part of the development team, my focus was on crafting the reservation module. Leveraging the power of CSS Flexbox, I designed a visually appealing and responsive interface that enhances the overall user experience. The Flexbox layout ensures that elements within the reservation system adapt dynamically to different screen sizes and device types, providing a seamless booking process for our customers.
